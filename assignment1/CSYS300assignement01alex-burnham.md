*Assumptions (including the information from assumptions a, b and f):*

$D_f \propto V^2l^2$  (assumption c)

$$P \propto D_fV$$  (assumption d)

$$N \propto l^3$$  (assumption e)

$$P \propto N$$  (assumption g)

*Operation:*

1) Substitute $D_f \propto V^2l^2$ into $$P \propto D_fV$$ then substitute $$P$$ for $$l^3$$ using assumptions g and e:

$l^3 \propto V^3l^2$  

2) Divide $l^3$ by $l^2$, rearrange assumption e ($$l \propto N^{1/3}$$) and substitute in after division: 

 $l^3/l^2 \propto (V^3l^2)/l^2$ 

($$N^{1/3} \propto V^3$$)

3) Take the cube root of both sides and simplify: 

 $\sqrt[3]{N^{1/3}} \propto \sqrt[3]{(V^3}$  

 $V \propto N^{1/9}$
